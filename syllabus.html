		<p> <B>Course goals</B> <br> Familiarize students with rigorous formulation of probability theory, and introduce them to the theory of discrete and continuous-time stochastic processes.<br> 

		<p> <B> Detailed Syllabus </B> 
		<br> <I> Part 1: Probability theory </I> 
		<ul>
			<li>Sigma Algebras and Probability measures - definition and examples, product sigma algebras, product measures, induced measures.
			<li> Measurable functions and random variables - laws and distributions, integrability, moments, sequences of random variables, Gaussian random variables and examples.
			<li> Independence, conditional probabilities/expectations - formulations based on sigma-algebras.
			<li> Concentration inequalities - Markov, Chebyshev's inequalities, central limit theorem, Hoeffding's inequalities.
		</ul>
		<I> Part 2: Discrete-time Stochastic Processes </I> 
		<ul>
